/* using namespace std: telling the cpp compiler that everything here is using this namespace so i dont have to type std:: every time
return 0;: returns some sort of value, not realy necesery in cpp
I can use \n to make spcaces between words 
also i can use <<(theese are called insertion operators(they basicly pass along data))endl(end line) which works the same as \n
